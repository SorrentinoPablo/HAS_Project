Home Automation System - LM35 Temperature Sensor - Motor - LED Brightness

The Domotic Project is an innovative home automation project that uses three Blue Pill
microcontrollers, connected via Bluetooth to an App, which in turn communicates with a server created
for the project. The three microcontrollers are responsible for different functionalities: temperature and
humidity sensing, motor control, and dimmer signal for controlling light brightness.

The first microcontroller in the system is equipped with a temperature and humidity sensor, which
continuously measures the ambient temperature and humidity levels in the home. This data is
transmitted to the mobile phone via Bluetooth for display and logging on the server. Users can remotely
monitor the temperature and humidity levels in their home in real-time, enabling them to take
appropriate actions if it is desired.

The second microcontroller in the system is responsible for motor control. It can drive and control
various motorized appliances in the home, such as a motorized window blind or a motorized gate. The
mobile phone interface allows users to remotely open or close these motorized appliances, providing
convenient and flexible control options.

The third microcontroller in the system generates a dimmer signal for controlling the brightness of
a light. It can receive commands from the mobile phone via Bluetooth to adjust the brightness level of
a connected light source. This allows users to remotely control the brightness of a light, creating a
customized lighting experience in their home.

All three microcontrollers are connected to a mobile phone via Bluetooth, which serves as the central
control interface for the entire system. The mobile phone communicates with a server created for the
project, which handles data logging, processing, and communication with the microcontrollers.
